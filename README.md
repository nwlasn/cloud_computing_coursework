## This coursework is an example of complexity of coding/problem-solving I am able to achieve. The instructions can be found in the "Coursework description" file.

## After running the codes in the cloud on AWS, the following lists have been returned:

- pairs.py: "my" ->	["wife", "girlfriend", "friend", "dad", "women", "life", "mom", "favorite", "coffee", "son"]
- stripes.py: "my" ->	["wife", "girlfriend", "friend", "dad", "women", "life", "mom", "favorite", "coffee", "son"]
- complete_pagerank.py: "top10"	-> [18, 4415, 737, 790, 1753, 143, 1719, 136, 751, 118]

and were confirmed to be correct.

## None of the codes has been changed since submitting, therefore there is room for improvement, for example in terms of the code readability
