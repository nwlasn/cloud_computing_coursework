## The files in this repository are included in order to show the examples of complexity of coding/problem-solving I am able to achieve.

## Additional files that make the code run/work can be added upon request.

## The tasks from the coursework can be found in the "Coursework description" file.

## The results (answers) that the .py files in this repository yield are the following:

- pairs.py: "my" ->	["wife", "girlfriend", "friend", "dad", "women", "life", "mom", "favorite", "coffee", "son"]
- stripes.py: "my" ->	["wife", "girlfriend", "friend", "dad", "women", "life", "mom", "favorite", "coffee", "son"]
- complete_pagerank.py: "top10"	-> [18, 4415, 737, 790, 1753, 143, 1719, 136, 751, 118]

and were confirmed to be correct.

## None of the codes has been changed since submitting, therefore there is definitely room for improvement, especially in terms of making the code more readable for others.
